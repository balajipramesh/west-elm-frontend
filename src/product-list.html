        <font color='black'>At west elm we're focused on the intersection of modern design, affordability and community. Everything we sell—from
          sofas and tables to bedding and vases—is made with one goal in mind: to help our customers express their personal
          style at home and in the world. We care about impact too. By designing over 90% of our products in–house, our design
          team has steadily increased our selection of organic, handcrafted, sustainably sourced and Fair Trade Certified™
          products. There's a story behind everything we sell—one that starts in Brooklyn and lives on with you.</font>
